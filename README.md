# Environment
This repository simply sets up my development environment for Ubuntu 20.04,22.04,24.04<br>
I setup VMs so often, it has gotten to the point where I am tired of re-running the same commands<br>
This will consist of the tools I use daily:
- My window manager
- Terminal preference
- .bashrc
- Neovim configuration
- etc.

Just run the setup.sh script, and once the configuration is done, the device will reboot
