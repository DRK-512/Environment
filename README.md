# Environment
I bounce between linux distrobutions so often, it has gotten to the point where I am tired of re-running the same commands<br>
This repo was only made for me to reference my default setup<br>
This will consist of the tools I use daily:
- My window manager
- Terminal preference
- .bashrc
- Neovim configuration
- etc.
